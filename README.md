Oracle Database Monitoring Script

Created to monitor Oracle 11gR2 databases running Linux on both ASM and raw file systems.

Currently only build files are included in the repo.

There are examples of the template files and OS changes you will need to create.

Main todo is to write up install and usage instructions here.
